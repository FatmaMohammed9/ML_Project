Ideally situated upon a knoll on 2.5 of the most private acres, it has been home to some of Montgomery County's founding families. It was modernized in the 1930s and those original features still define the home; 1' thick American black walnut wide plank flooring, wood moldings, bohemian crystal chandeliers, a stained glass wall, expansive terraces in sparkling West Virginia fieldstone, tall 10' ceilings and large windows that make it light and bright. The most enchanting feature of the home is its magnificent curved staircase which leads you past the 4' chandelier. Then, prepare to be wowed as you enter the magazine-worthy 2019 kitchen done at a cost of well over 150k. From the handmade tile on the heated floor, custom cabinetry with inset doors to the stunning natural quartzite slab counters, unlacquered Barber Wilsons London brass fixtures, to boxed beam ceilings, every effort was made to evoke the feeling of a period kitchen. The 'piece de resistance' of the kitchen is without a doubt the pale blue 'La Cornue' range. Outside, the grounds inspire with their mature trees and winding paths and hedging that provides so much privacy that many neighbors don't even know the home is there! Two ancient Linden trees anchor the front yard and one of them is a Montgomery County champion tree. Just 6 minutes from the ICC/MD200 highway, and a pleasant 7-minute walk through the park gets you to the town of Olney with its many fine restaurants. Some mentionables include a fruit tree orchard, dog kennel or chicken coop, basement workshop, finished attic with five storage walk-in closets, dedicated laundry and housekeeping space, formal entrance and drive, back entrance and drive, neighborhood pool membership available, no historical restrictions and the property sides to a greenbelt. Freshly painted with Farrow and Ball throughout. If you are finding large homes cavernous and new homes already looking dated, Howard Hall is the perfect blend of a cozy and classic livable family home.
